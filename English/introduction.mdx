Tra Su spans nearly 850 hectares. Located approximately 250 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City, Tra Su is nestled in Van Giao Commune, Tinh Bien District, An Giang Province.  

It plays a crucial role in regulating the water environment and climate across the region.  

This dynamic eco-destination is traversed by a four-km bamboo bridge. Visitors can take motorboat tours, and engage in unique wildlife activities and experiences.  

The area has been developed into a sanctuary for a variety of rare and exotic birds and wildlife native to the Mekong Delta, making it an integral part of Vietnam's special-use forest system.

Local guides steer boats through meandering waterways, taking tourists into the center of the forest. As you glide along, you'll witness birds perched on tree trunks and vibrant lotus blossoms in many hues.  

The Tra Su cajuput forest also enjoys the distinction of being featured in the film "Southern Forest Land," directed by Nguyen Quang Dung, which recently premiered in Vietnam.

### **WHAT TO DO**

**The longest bamboo bridge in Vietnam**

The bamboo bridge traversing the forest holds the distinction of being the longest in Vietnam, recognized by the Vietnam Record Organization. It now boasts an impressive length of four kilometers.

The first phase of the bridge was completed and operational in early 2020, with a length of nearly four kilometers. This section of the bridge used over 500,000 bamboo trees of various types and cost more than VND5 billion (US$204,900) to build. The construction of the second phase, spanning approximately six kilometers, is currently underway.

The bamboo bridge is divided into five branches. As you venture deeper into the forest, the scenery on both sides of the bridge becomes increasingly beautiful, and the environment grows quieter and cooler. The bridge leads to the motorboat wharf, providing visitors with a point to embark and disembark.

**Exploring the forest by motorboat or canoe**

Motorboats offer a swifter and longer journey, taking visitors through canals and deep into the heart of the forest. Along the way, you can witness locals collecting cajuput flower honey from containers placed within the forest.

Touring the cajuput forest by motorboat or canoe also presents an opportunity for visitors to capture beautiful photos in the midst of the lush surroundings. On sunny days, the sunlight filtering through the trees creates a truly enchanting atmosphere.

Within the Tra Su cajuput forest, you'll find 12 stalls offering a variety of souvenirs and local specialties. These items include palm sugar, cajuput flower honey, assorted dried fruits, soft drinks, cajuput oil, brocade towels, straw hats, and art furniture.

### **WHAT TO EAT**

Tra Su Restaurant provides two main dining areas. One is outside the forest gate, on both sides of the pier, and the other is a floating hut area on the water within the forest, adjacent to the watchtower.

In these dining areas, visitors can savor southern-style specialties such as grilled snakehead fish, _ca linh_ fish (henicorhynchus) and river hemp flower hotpot, fermented fish hotpot, coconut core salad, and crispy pancakes.

### WHEN TO VISIT

From September to November annually, the flood season showcases the cajuput forest's splendor. Abundant water turns the forest lush, and a layer of duckweed blankets the water, a captivating sight. The flood season also fosters ideal conditions for fish and shrimp growth and invites various bird species.
