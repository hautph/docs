For train travel, the fastest option is the Thong Nhat Train, which connects Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in approximately 30 hours. The train makes stops at stations in major cities such as Vinh, Dong Hoi, Hue, and Da Nang in central Vietnam. It is recommended to book tickets through reputable agents or directly through Vietnam Railways Corporation via its website dsvn.vn.

Using ride-hailing services (cars or motorbikes) within Ho Chi Minh City is a convenient option. However, continuous usage can become costly.
